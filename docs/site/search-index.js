This module depends on Domain module that provides components implementing the required business logic for the use cases. Application module is also responsible for manage transactionality and event publication. Every endpoint module such as web, messaging, etc. should depend on this module where they can found the implementations of required use cases. Responsibilities Implement application use cases.

Responsibilities Spring web configurations Spring rest based controllers definition Spring security configuration, including basic & JWT auth Key components * Controller classes * Config classes for infrastructure features. E.G. WebSecurityConfig The general package structure and naming is defined by the following guide: Config: Contains the Main Config for the module that will be the entry point for the component scan and other module’s dependencies definition using Spring’s @Import statements. This package will also contain additional feature enable configurations such as Web MVC, Web Security, Cache, Observability, AOP, etc. Every feature configuration will be located in it’s related module if it’s only used in / affecting it (E.G. Web MVC in Web module) or in Infrastructure module if it’s a global feature (E.G. AOP, Observability, Caches) Event: Contains general event definition and listeners. The main use case for these events is to be used as entry point for an external general event, such as Spring’s lifecycle events (E.G. ApplicationStartedEvent) that can be used to trigger module general actions. Context specific event definitions / listeners must be defined in context related subpackage Contexts: A context should contain components related to a specific bounded context of the domain or concept in the application. Every context can define its Exposed service interfaces at the root of the module. Implementations for own Service interfaces will be placed in impl subpackage. Also, a special context named Common can be defined as a place to put shared components that can be used by other contexts and doesn’t have enough meaning to put then in its own context. Common context will not contain general configs or event listeners because they aren’t dependencies of other contexts. In that case, these components can be placed in top config and event/listeners packages of the module because in that Module Package Marker Interface: Java interface intended to be used in Spring’s component scans as type-safe alternative to basePackages for specifying the packages to scan for annotated components. Every module has its own module config class in charge of trigger the component scan on himself. It is also possible to filter components that doesn’t have to be scanned automatically because they are optional and must be manually imported using an @Import annotation. The marker annotation IgnoreOnComponentScan can be used to do that. E.G. @Configuration // This class will be ignored by automatic component scan @IgnoreOnComponentScan public class OptionalConfig { } //---------------------------------- @Configuration @ComponentScan( basePackageClasses = { IWebPackage.class }, excludeFilters = @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ANNOTATION, classes = IgnoreOnComponentScan.class) ) public class WebModuleConfig { } As explained in Main module's description section, all module configurations will be assembled in the MainModuleConfig class using @Import annotation. The modules presented in this document follow the Onion Architecture schema. The execution flow goes from the outermost part of the \"onion\" to the inside, from left to right. Instead of having separate modules for every module defined in this Architecture document, they can be defined as a layered architecture in the same package. Every module can be transformed in a subpackage. The same way that we can have a single layered module, we can also merge / split the modules explained before. Examples of merge modules: Web module can be integrated into Infrastructure and Application modules, putting configurations in the first one and controllers in the second. Define the Domain layer in a separate module and put the others in a common module. By this way, we can isolate domain business logic from framework dependant components. Merge Application and Domain layers in a Core module so that application’s use cases and business logic are isolated from input / output (E.G. web controllers and persistence)","title":"Architecture","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"architecture","url":"/springboot-showcase/ways-of-working/explanation/architecture.html","titles":[{"text":"Modules","hash":"modules","id":1},{"text":"Main","hash":"_main_module_description","id":2},{"text":"Application","hash":"application","id":3},{"text":"Infrastructure","hash":"infrastructure","id":4},{"text":"Domain","hash":"domain","id":5},{"text":"Web","hash":"web","id":6},{"text":"Module general structure","hash":"module-general-structure","id":7},{"text":"Packages","hash":"packages","id":8},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"configuration","id":9},{"text":"Interactions","hash":"interactions","id":10},{"text":"Variations","hash":"variations","id":11},{"text":"Layered module","hash":"layered-module","id":12},{"text":"Split / merge modules","hash":"split-merge-modules","id":13}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"This document introduces the design for a fluent API allowing executing different operations defined by a remote service. Given a remote service API, we can define the following concepts: Resource: Full path to the resource. E.G. /categories/1 (Sub)collection: URL path that groups resources. E.G. The /categories/1 resource is defined under /categories collection. Also, we can define sub-collections under a main collection. E.G. we can have /products sub-collection under /categories/{id} main collection (/categories/{id}/products) Operation: Action to be done on the resource or (sub)collection, usually a CRUD operation. In order to illustrate the design, we introduce the following API that models a service to operate with categorized products: We have a remote service API that defines 2 main collections: /info and /categories: /info collection defines the following operation: get version doing a GET request to the /info/version endpoint /categories collection defines the following operations: list categories doing a GET request to the /categories endpoint get a specific category detail doing a GET request to the /categories/{id} endpoint create a new category doing a POST request to the /categories endpoint update an existent category doing a PUT request to the /categories/{id} endpoint delete an existent category doing a DELETE request to the /categories/{id} endpoint /categories domain defines the sub-collection /products for each element on it /categories/products subdomain defines the following operations: list fields belonging to a product doing a GET request to the /categories/{category id}/products endpoint In a schematic way: With the previous concepts, we can define a series of client API elements to access them: Used as entrypoint to the client API providing access to implemented API Builders for service API collections. Wraps the underlying client that will be used to consume the service API, providing also a builder to create and configure it. This client wrapper creates an independent layer that makes possible to use different underlying clients (E.G. Spring’s RestClient, RestTemplate, OkHttp3…​) maintaining the same API. API Builders provide methods to access and configure operations to be executed on the different collections or resources supported by the Client using its top level API methods. An API Builder should be usually created using collection related data and then select the operation that should be executed. If the operation does not define additional intermediate methods, the operation selection method can execute directly the operation, returning the resulting data directly (if any). E.G. // ElementApiBuilder.java . . . public SomeElement update(SomeElementInputData newData) { // Create update operation using required arguments and execute it directly return new UpdateOperation(..., newData).update(); } . . . We can define several kinds of Api Builder classes depending on its target type: SetApiBuilder: Meant to be used for operations over datasets (retrieval, batch update…​). The builder may or may not receive as input a filter / selector to limit the dataset affected. CreationApiBuilder: Meant to be used for element creation operations targeting a specific (sub)collection. The builder will receive the data to send to the server as input. ElementApiBuilder: Meant to be used for individual element data retrieval or manipulation involving a unique identifier received as input An ApiBuilder can also be used to group other `ApiBuilder`s, at top level or nested collection level. In that case it will contain calls to other builders if it’s needed to access to a grouped / nested collection builder or operation API. Operations are the final operators of the API in charge of execute the final call to the remote service using de underlying configured client. They define a method in charge of executing the operation (E.G. get() for data retrieving, execute() for modifying data, submit() for async data submission…​) along others intermediate methods meant to add or modify the data or behaviour of this execution. For example, a dataset retrieval operation may define intermediate methods like paginate(…​) or sort(…​) that configure the pagination parameters of the request. Following the explanation above, we can model our client API as follows: Entrypoint of client API. Provides methods to give access to the API Builders that group operations by collection. public class ServiceClient { // Underlying HTTP client instance private final RestClient restClient; private ServiceClient(RestClient restClient) { this.restClient = restClient; } public static Builder builder() { return new Builder(); } /* API Builders accessors */ public InfoApiBuilder infoApi() { return new InfoApiBuilder(restClient); } public CategoriesApiBuilder categoriesApi() { return new CategoryApiBuilder(restClient); } /* Builder allowing to configure the underlying client */ public static class Builder { // . . . } } Once implemented, we can get an instance of our client as follows: ServiceClient client = ServiceClient.builder() .withBaseUrl(remoteServiceUrl) .build(); Info API Builder provides access to every operation defined by the implemented collection. In this case it only have an operation, accessible through serviceVersion() method. public class InfoApiBuilder { private final RestClient restClient; public InfoApiBuilder(RestClient restClient) { this.restClient = restClient; } public ServiceVersionOperation serviceVersion() { return new ServiceVersionOperation(restClient); } } This is a simple Operation that only allows retrieving data through get() method and does not provide additional methods to configure additional parameters public class ServiceVersionOperation { private final RestClient restClient; ServiceVersionOperation(RestClient restClient) { this.restClient = restClient; } /* Method that executes the operation sending the request to the remote service */ public String get() { return restClient.get() .uri(\"/api/info/version\") .retrieve() .body(String.class); } } Usage example: String actualServiceVersion = client.infoApi() .serviceVersion() .get(); CategoryApiBuilder example shows how to group nested ApiBuilders by collection. It serves as an accessor to the specific ApiBuilders implementing Category collection: public class CategoryApiBuilder { private final RestClient restClient; public CategoryApiBuilder(RestClient restClient) { this(restClient); } public CategorySetApiBuilder categories() { return new CategorySetApiBuilder(restClient); } public CategorySetApiBuilder categories(CategorySetSelector selector) { return new CategorySetApiBuilder(restClient, selector); } public CategoryElementApiBuilder category(Long id) { return new CategoryElementApiBuilder(restClient, id); } public CategoryCreationApiBuilder category(CategoryData data) { return new CategoryCreationApiBuilder(restClient, data); } } CategorySetApiBuilder implements a complex example of a API Builder supporting parameters, allowing filtering the result set, and a configurable operation with additional intermediate methods: public class CategorySetApiBuilder { private final RestClient restClient; // Selector parameter received from Client that will be passed to downstream operations private final CategorySetSelector selector; public CategorySetApiBuilder(RestClient restClient) { this(restClient, null); } public CategorySetApiBuilder(RestClient restClient, CategorySetSelector selector) { this.restClient = restClient; this.selector = selector; } /* Selects the collection operation to execute */ public CategoryListOperation list() { return new CategoryListOperation(restClient, validator, selector); } } public class CategoryListOperation { public static final String ENDPOINT_PATH = \"/api/categories\"; private final RestClient restClient; private final CategorySetSelector selector; private Integer pageNumber; private Integer pageSize; CategoryListOperation(RestClient restClient, CategorySetSelector selector) { this.restClient = restClient; this.selector = selector; } /* Intermediate operation that allows specifying * additional parameters to the request */ public CategoryListOperation paginate(int pageNumber, int pageSize) { this.pageNumber = pageNumber; this.pageSize = pageSize; return this; } /* Method that executes the operation sending the request to the remote service */ public PaginatedResponse get() { return restClient.get() .uri(this::buildURI) .retrieve() .body(new ParameterizedTypeReference>(){}); } private URI buildURI(UriBuilder uriBuilder) { uriBuilder.path(ENDPOINT_PATH); if(selector != null) { uriBuilder.queryParam(\"selector\", URLEncoder.encode(selector.toString(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); } if(pageNumber!=null) { uriBuilder.queryParam(\"page\", pageNumber); } if(pageSize!=null) { uriBuilder.queryParam(\"pageSize\", pageSize); } return uriBuilder.build(); } } CategoryElementApiBuilder is an example of how we can implement multiple operations, with the possibility to bypass the operation, and subcollection `API Builder`s public class CategoryElementApiBuilder { private final RestClient restClient; private final Long id; public CategoryElementApiBuilder(RestClient restClient, Long id) { this.restClient = restClient; this.id = id; } /* Bypass operation and execute the operation directly, as this * operation is not configurable and doesn't provide additional methods */ public Optional get() { return new CategoryGetOperation(restClient, id).get(); } public Category update(CategoryData data) { return new CategoryUpdateOperation(restClient, id, data) .execute(); } public void delete() { return new CategoryDeleteOperation(restClient, id) .execute(); } /* Provide access to \"product\" subcollection API Builder. Parameters * received by this API Builder are propagated to the downstream API Builder */ public ProductSetApiBuilder products() { return new ProductSetApiBuilder(restClient, id); } } Bypassed Operation classes only have a method to execute the request on remote service API. public class CategoryGetOperation { public static final String ENDPOINT_PATH = \"/api/categories/{id}\"; private final RestClient restClient; private final Long id; CategoryGetOperation(RestClient restClient, Long id) { this.restClient = restClient; this.id = id; } public Optional get() { return Optional.ofNullable( restClient.get() .uri(this::buildURI) .retrieve() .body(Category.class) ); } private URI buildURI(UriBuilder uriBuilder) { uriBuilder.path(ENDPOINT_PATH); return uriBuilder.build(id); } } public class CategoryUpdateOperation { public static final String ENDPOINT_PATH = \"/api/categories/{id}\"; private final RestClient restClient; private final Long id; private final CategoryData data; CategoryUpdateOperation(RestClient restClient, Long id, CategoryData data) { this.restClient = restClient; this.id = id; this.data = data; } public Category execute() { return restClient.put() .uri(this::buildURI) .body(data) .retrieve() .body(Category.class); } private URI buildURI(UriBuilder uriBuilder) { uriBuilder.path(ENDPOINT_PATH); return uriBuilder.build(id); } } public class CategoryDeleteOperation { public static final String ENDPOINT_PATH = \"/api/categories/{id}\"; private final RestClient restClient; private final Long id; CategoryDeleteOperation(RestClient restClient, Long id) { this.restClient = restClient; this.id = id; } public void execute() { return restClient.delete() .uri(this::buildURI) .retrieve() .toBodilessEntity(); } private URI buildURI(UriBuilder uriBuilder) { uriBuilder.path(ENDPOINT_PATH); return uriBuilder.build(id); } } Here we have the sub-collection API Builder that is called from the main collection API Builder. It receives the needed parameters from it and configure `Operation`s according to them. public class ProductSetApiBuilder { private final RestClient restClient; private final Long categoryId; public ProductSetApiBuilder(RestClient restClient, Long categoryId) { this.restClient = restClient; this.categoryId = categoryId; } public PaginatedResponse list() { return new ProductListOperation(restClient, categoryId).get(); } } public class ProductListOperation { public static final String ENDPOINT_PATH = \"/api/categories/{categoryId}/product\"; private final RestClient restClient; private final Long categoryId; ProductListOperation(RestClient restClient, Long categoryId) { this.restClient = restClient; this.categoryId = categoryId; } public PaginatedResponse get() { return restClient.get() .uri(this::buildURI) .retrieve() .body(new ParameterizedTypeReference>(){}); } private URI buildURI(UriBuilder uriBuilder) { uriBuilder.path(ENDPOINT_PATH); return uriBuilder.build(categoryId); } } CategoryCreationApiBuilder is another example of a API Builder bypassing operations, as the required data is obtained at the top level client call public class CategoryCreationApiBuilder { private final RestClient restClient; private final CategoryData data; public CategoryCreationApiBuilder(RestClient restClient, CategoryData data) { this.restClient = restClient; this.data = data; } public Category create() { return new CategoryCreateOperation(restClient, data) .create(); } } public class CategoryCreateOperation { public static final String ENDPOINT_PATH = \"/api/categories\"; private final RestClient restClient; private final CategoryData data; CategoryCreateOperation(RestClient restClient, CategoryData data) { this.restClient = restClient; this.data = data; } public Category execute() { return restClient.post() .uri(this::buildURI) .body(data) .retrieve() .body(Category.class); } private URI buildURI(UriBuilder uriBuilder) { uriBuilder.path(ENDPOINT_PATH); return uriBuilder.build(); } } Some usage examples: // Category list PaginatedResponse response = client.categoryApi() .categories() .list() .paginate(0, 10) .get(); // Product list PaginatedResponse response = client.categoryApi() .category(1001L) .products() .list(); CategoryData categoryData = buildCategoryData(); // Category creation Category response = client.categoryApi() .category(categoryData) .create(); // Category update Category response = client.categoryApi() .category(1001L) .update(categoryData);","title":"Fluent REST API client","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"fluent_rest_api_client","url":"/springboot-showcase/ways-of-working/explanation/fluent_rest_api_client.html","titles":[{"text":"Concept","hash":"concept","id":1},{"text":"Client","hash":"client","id":2},{"text":"API Builders","hash":"api-builders","id":3},{"text":"Operations","hash":"operations","id":4},{"text":"Example","hash":"example","id":5},{"text":"Client","hash":"client-2","id":6},{"text":"Info API","hash":"info-api","id":7},{"text":"Category API","hash":"category-api","id":8}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"If we need to mock an external service during application development, we can configure a Wiremock container as part of the docker-compose-DEV.yaml service stack: # . . . services: # . . . wiremock: container_name: wiremock image: \"wiremock/wiremock:3.4.2-1\" ports: - 8100:8080 entrypoint: [ \"/docker-entrypoint.sh\", \"--global-response-templating\", \"--disable-gzip\", \"--verbose\" ] volumes: - ./wiremock/extensions:/var/wiremock/extensions - ./wiremock/__files:/home/wiremock/__files - ./wiremock/mappings:/home/wiremock/mappings This configuration allow us to access mock server through port 8100.

The content of this response is located in api/inventory/get_list_body.json file located in the __files folder. { \"priority\": 10, \"request\": { \"method\": \"GET\", \"urlPath\": \"/api/inventory\", \"queryParameters\": { \"selector\": { \"equalTo\": \"id EQUALS 1\" }, \"page\": { \"equalTo\": \"0\" }, \"pageSize\": { \"equalTo\": \"10\" } } }, \"response\": { \"status\": 200, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, \"bodyFileName\": \"api/inventory/get_list_body.json\" } } Once the service is started, we can manage expectations using Wiremock’s Admin API as follows: Get all defined expectations curl http://localhost:8100/__admin/mappings Create a new expectation using the API curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d ' { \"id\": \"12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012\", \"priority\": 10, \"request\": { \"method\": \"GET\", \"url\": \"/api/sample\" }, \"response\": { \"status\": 200, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, \"bodyFileName\": \"api/sample/get_sample_body.json\" } } ' http://localhost:8100/__admin/mappings Update an existing expectation using the API curl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d ' { \"priority\": 10, \"request\": { \"method\": \"GET\", \"url\": \"/api/sample\" }, \"response\": { \"status\": 200, \"headers\": { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, \"jsonBody\": [1, 2, 3, 4] } } ' http://localhost:8100/__admin/mappings/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 Reload expectations from /mappings files This option makes possible to modify expectations editing mappings files directly and then reload Wiremock state curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/__admin/mappings/reset Wiremock reference documentation","title":"Mocking external services","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"mocking_an_external_service","url":"/springboot-showcase/ways-of-working/how-to/mocking_an_external_service.html","titles":[{"text":"Wiremock","hash":"wiremock","id":1},{"text":"Expectations configuration","hash":"expectations-configuration","id":2},{"text":"Request matcher","hash":"request-matcher","id":3},{"text":"Response configuration","hash":"response-configuration","id":4},{"text":"Example","hash":"example","id":5},{"text":"Wiremock Admin API","hash":"wiremock-admin-api","id":6},{"text":"References","hash":"references","id":7}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"Actuator endpoints must be enabled in application.properties exposing only necessary endpoints. management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=false management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=info,metrics,health In addition, every endpoint should be enabled individually (See sections below for more details) Enabled endpoints can be accessed through /actuator by default. This can be changed using the base-path configuration in application.properties: management.endpoints.web.base-path: /public/actuator This endpoint allows display information about the application through /actuator/info endpoint including build information generated by spring-boot-maven-plugin Maven plugin and random information included in application.properties. First of all, we need to enable the endpoint in application.properties management.endpoint.info.enabled=true To provide build information is necessary to configure spring-boot-maven-plugin executing the build-info goal. org.springframework.boot spring-boot-maven-plugin build-info build-info This will generate build-info.properties file inside /target/META-INF folder with this info. E.G. build.artifact=springboot-showcase-main build.group=com.bitsmi.springboot-showcase build.name=springboot-showcase-main build.time=2024-03-16T08\\:32\\:12.088Z build.version=2.0.0-SNAPSHOT Custom information can be added in application.properties enabling management.info.env.enabled property and specifying them using info prefix.

After doing these configurations, /actuator/info will provide us with a response like this: { \"app\": { \"name\": \"springboot-showcase-main\", \"description\": \"SpringBoot Showcase Main\", \"version\": \"1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\" }, \"build\": { \"artifact\": \"springboot-showcase-main\", \"name\": \"springboot-showcase-main\", \"time\": \"2024-03-16T08:32:12.088Z\", \"version\": \"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\", \"group\": \"com.bitsmi.springboot-showcase\" } } This endpoint allows display information about application’s health through /actuator/health endpoint, including built-in and custom health indicators. First of all, we need to enable the endpoint in application.properties management.endpoint.health.enabled=true And configure the visibility of the endpoint: management.endpoint.health.show-details=always management.endpoint.health.show-components=always The properties above can be configured with one of the following values: never when-authorized: Only visible for authorized roles configured in management.endpoint.health.roles property always: Visible for all users. We can use this value also if we want to manage the access to these endpoints directly in Spring-security configuration. E.G. private void authorizeHttpRequestsBasic(AuthorizeHttpRequestsConfigurer.AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry configurer) { configurer .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, \"/actuator/**\").hasAnyRole(UserConstants.USER_GROUP_ADMIN, UserConstants.USER_GROUP_MONITORING) .anyRequest().authenticated(); } Spring Boot auto-configures the HealthIndicators listed in the following table (if module is in classpath and auto-configuration is enabled). You can also enable or disable selected indicators by configuring management.health.key.enabled, with the key listed in the following table: Key Name Description cassandra CassandraDriverHealthIndicator Checks that a Cassandra database is up. couchbase CouchbaseHealthIndicator Checks that a Couchbase cluster is up. db DataSourceHealthIndicator Checks that a connection to DataSource can be obtained. diskspace DiskSpaceHealthIndicator Checks for low disk space. elasticsearch ElasticsearchRestClientHealthIndicator Checks that an Elasticsearch cluster is up. hazelcast HazelcastHealthIndicator Checks that a Hazelcast server is up. influxdb InfluxDbHealthIndicator Checks that an InfluxDB server is up. jms JmsHealthIndicator Checks that a JMS broker is up. ldap LdapHealthIndicator Checks that an LDAP server is up. mail MailHealthIndicator Checks that a mail server is up. mongo MongoHealthIndicator Checks that a Mongo database is up. neo4j Neo4jHealthIndicator Checks that a Neo4j database is up. ping PingHealthIndicator Always responds with UP. rabbit RabbitHealthIndicator Checks that a Rabbit server is up. redis RedisHealthIndicator Checks that a Redis server is up. Additional HealthIndicators are available but are not enabled by default: Key Name Description livenessstate LivenessStateHealthIndicator Exposes the “Liveness” application availability state. readinessstate ReadinessStateHealthIndicator Exposes the “Readiness” application availability state. We can create additional custom health indicators implementing org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.HealthIndicator interface or extending org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.AbstractHealthIndicator class. For example, if we want to create a Kafka indicator that tell us if the Kafka Broker is UP or DOWN, we can implement as this: @Component @ConditionalOnEnabledHealthIndicator(\"kafka\") public class KafkaHealthIndicator extends AbstractHealthIndicator { private final AdminClient kafkaAdminClient; public KafkaHealthIndicator(KafkaAdmin kafkaAdmin) { this.kafkaAdminClient = AdminClient.create(kafkaAdmin.getConfigurationProperties()); } @Override protected void doHealthCheck(Builder builder) throws Exception { final DescribeClusterOptions options = new DescribeClusterOptions().timeoutMs(1000); DescribeClusterResult clusterDescription = kafkaAdminClient.describeCluster(options); // When Kafka is not connected future.get() throws an exception which in turn sets the indicator DOWN. clusterDescription.clusterId().get(); builder.up().build(); // Alternatively directly use data from future in health detail. builder.up() .withDetail(\"clusterId\", clusterDescription.clusterId().get()) .withDetail(\"nodeCount\", clusterDescription.nodes().get().size()) .build(); } } If we extend the AbstractHealthIndicator class this will allow us to include additional information through the provided builder. In the example, the clusterId and the nodeCount fields. The name of the indicator class should follow the convention HealthIndicator so Spring will know the indicator name related to the configuration properties related to it. To allow to enable / disable a custom indicator through it’s corresponding configuration property, we must include the @ConditionalOnEnabledHealthIndicator annotation specifying the indicator name to it. Health indicators can be grouped creating a property in application.properties with the following format management.endpoint.health.group..include. E.G. Create a group named infrastructure with only db and kafka indicators. management.endpoint.health.group.infrastructure.include=db,kafka Doing this we can get the full list of indicators through /actuators/health endpoint and only the ones tagged as infrastruture using the /actuators/health/infrastructure endpoint. Indicators can be configured to display information or not in /actuators/health. This can be achieved setting true or false in the corresponding management.health..enabled property. Default indicators can be all enabled / disabled at once using the management.health.defaults.enabled. # Only expose DB and ping components (only applies to default indicators) management.health.defaults.enabled=false management.health.db.enabled=true management.health.ping.enabled=true # Custom management.health.kafka.enabled=true If an indicator is disabled, remove it from groups, otherwise it will raise an error and application won’t start.

Here is a basic guide on how to: Having a single bean candidate and a single injection point, that is the base case when we define a bean and use @Autowired annotation to inject it Having multiple bean candidates of the same type and a single injection point. Here we can define a default bean or use identifiers to select which one will be injected Having zero bean candidates for a type and a single injection point, which means that we can have optional beans Having multiple bean candidates of the same type and a multiple injection point, allowing accessing all beans for the specified type in the same injection point Having conditional bean candidates that are only available when a condition is met Create and inject prototype scoped beans We can use Spring's @Primary annotation to mark a specific bean to be the default candidate to be injected in single injection points. Definition: @Service @Primary public class MainProductServiceImpl implements ProductService { // . . . } Injection (Field): @Service public class Store { @Autowired private ProductService defaultProductService; // . . . } Injection (Constructor): @Service public class Store { private final ProductService productService; public Store(ProductService productService) { this.productService = productService; } // . . . } Individual beans for a same type are still available if we use the @Qualifier annotation. In that case, we need to specify an identifier for the individual bean and use it at definition and injection points. Definition: @Service @Qualifier(\"ADDITIONAL_PRODUCT\") public class AdditionalProductServiceImpl implements ProductService { // . . . } Injection (Field): @Service public class Store { @Autowired @Qualifier(\"ADDITIONAL_PRODUCT\") private ProductService additionalProductService; // . . . } Injection (Constructor): @Service public class Store { private final ProductService additionalProductService; public Store(@Qualifier(\"ADDITIONAL_PRODUCT\") ProductService additionalProductService) { this.additionalProductService = additionalProductService; } // . . . } In case we have no bean candidates for a type, it is required to use the required = false flag in @Autowired annotation Injection (Field): @Service public class Store { @Autowired(required = false) private ProductService defaultProductService; // . . . } Injection (Constructor): @Service public class Store { private final ProductService productService; public Store(@Autowired(required = false) ProductService productService) { this.productService = productService; } // . . . } In that case the bean instance will be null at runtime. We have to handle this every time that we want to use it in the code. Alternatively, we can wrap the bean instance with an Optional or ObjectProvider so we can handle easily the null case: Injection of an Optional: @Service public class Store { @Autowired private Optional productService; // . . . public Optional getProductName() { return productService .map(ProductService::getProductName); } } Injection of an ObjectProvider: @Service public class Store { @Autowired private ObjectProvider productService; // . . . public Optional getProductName() { return productService.stream() .findAny() .map(ProductService::getProductName); } } We can also use ObjectProvider and a Collection when we have multiple beans of the same type: Injection of an ObjectProvider: @Service public class Store { @Autowired private ObjectProvider productService; // . . . public List getProductNames() { return productService.stream() .map(ProductService::getProductName) .toList(); } } Injection of a List: @Service public class Store { @Autowired private List productService; // . . . public List getProductNames() { return productService.stream() .map(ProductService::getProductName) .toList(); } } Using conditional binding allow us to create a bean instance only if a condition is met. We can add a condition to any bean defined with a stereotype annotation (@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller), a @Configuration or a @Bean creation. Spring-boot provides many built-in conditions such as: Conditional on profile Beans annotated with @Profile(\"\") will only be available if the specified Spring profile is active. @Service @Profile(\"profile1\") public class StoreService { // . . . } @Profile annotation accepts also an expression involving multiple profiles and logical operations AND (&), OR (|) and NOT (!) @Service @Profile(\"!profile1 & (profile2 | profile3)\") public class StoreService { // . . . } Or an array of multiple profiles, resolved as a logical AND between the specified values @Service @Profile({ \"profile1\", \"profile2\" }) public class StoreService { // . . . } Conditional on property @ConditionalOnProperty annotation allows to load beans conditionally depending on a certain environment property @Service @ConditionalOnProperty( value = \"store.service.enabled\" ) public class StoreService { // . . . } Conditional on expression If we have a logical expression involving more than one property, we can use @ConditionalOnExpression annotation instead of @ConditionalOnProperty` and use Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to write the condition @Service @ConditionalOnExpression( \"${store.module.enabled:true} and ${store.service.enabled:true}\" ) public class StoreService { // . . . } In that example, condition will evaluate to true if both some.module.enabled and some.service.enabled properties are true, taking true as default value if the property is not present. Conditional on bean or on a missing bean @ConditionalOnBean annotation allows to load beans conditionally depending on the presence of a specific bean in the context @Service @ConditionalOnBean(ProductService.class) public class ProductStoreService { // . . . } Alternatively we can use @ConditionalOnMissingBean to load when the required bean is missing @Service @ConditionalOnMissingBean(ProductService.class) public class EmptyStoreService { // . . . } Both annotations accept more than 1 bean. All specified beans must (not)exists so that the condition resolves to true Conditional on class or on a missing class @ConditionalOnClass annotation allows to load beans conditionally depending on the presence of a specific class in classpath @Service @ConditionalOnClass(\"com.bitsmi.store.ProductService\") public class ProductStoreService { // . . . } Alternatively we can use @ConditionalOnMissingClass to load when the required class is missing @Service @ConditionalOnMissingClass(\"com.bitsmi.store.ProductService\") public class EmptyStoreService { // . . . } Both annotations accept more than 1 class. All specified classes must (not)exists so that the condition resolves to true Conditional on resource @ConditionalOnResource annotation allows to load beans conditionally depending on the presence of a specific resource on classpath @Service @ConditionalOnResource( \"logback.xml\" ) public class LogbackService { // . . . } Conditional on Java version @ConditionalOnJava annotation allows to load beans conditionally only if running a certain version of Java import org.springframework.boot.system.JavaVersion; @Service @ConditionalOnJava(JavaVersion.SEVENTEEN) public class StoreServiceJava17Impl { // . . . } In addition to Spring's built-in conditions, we can create our own ones implementing Condition interface: import org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils; class OnUnixCondition implements Condition { @Override public boolean matches(ConditionContext context, AnnotatedTypeMetadata metadata) { return SystemUtils.IS_OS_LINUX; } } // . . . @Bean @Conditional(OnUnixCondition.class) UnixService unixService() { return new UnixService(); } // . . . In case of be necessary, we can create an annotation to provide additional data that will take part in the resolution of condition. We will know these annotations as @ConditionalOn…​ @Target({ ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD }) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Documented @Conditional(OnSystemNameCondition.class) public @interface ConditionalOnSystemName { String[] value(); } import org.springframework.core.type.AnnotatedTypeMetadata; import org.springframework.util.MultiValueMap; class OnSystemNameCondition implements Condition { @Override public boolean matches(ConditionContext context, AnnotatedTypeMetadata metadata) { boolean matches = false; MultiValueMap attrs = metadata.getAllAnnotationAttributes(ConditionalOnSystemName.class.getName()); if (attrs != null) { // Annotation attribute values String[] osNames = (String[])attrs.get(\"value\"); matches = isAcceptedOs(osNames); } return matches; } // . . . } @Service @ConditionalOnSystemName({ \"Windows\", \"Linux\" }) public class SystemDependantService { // . . . } We can specify multiple conditions that will be evaluated in order to resolve if the bean will be available. If we want to achieve an OR logic, we will have to create a new condition that extends AnyNestedCondition and wraps individual conditions as nested classes class OnTestOrDevProfileCondition extends AnyNestedCondition { OnTestOrDevCondition() { super(ConfigurationPhase.REGISTER_BEAN); } @Profile(\"DEV\") static class OnDev {} @Profile(\"Test\") static class OnTest {} } @Service @Conditional(OnTestOrDevProfileCondition.class) public class DevOrTestService { // . . . } The same approach can be followed to create a custom annotation combining multiple conditions in a single @ConditionalOn…​ annotation using AND logic, extending AllNestedConditions class, or a NONE logic extending NoneNestedCondition class. AND combined conditions class OnTestingJava17Condition extends AllNestedCondition { OnTestingJava8Condition() { super(ConfigurationPhase.REGISTER_BEAN); } @Profile(\"TEST\") static class OnTest {} @ConditionalOnJava(JavaVersion.SEVENTEEN) static class OnJava17 {} } @Service @Conditional(OnTestingJava17Condition.class) public class Java17TestService { // . . . } NONE combined conditions class OnUnsupportedJavaVersionCondition extends NoneNestedCondition { OnUnsupportedJavaVersionCondition() { super(ConfigurationPhase.REGISTER_BEAN); } @ConditionalOnJava(JavaVersion.SEVENTEEN) static class OnJava17 {} @ConditionalOnJava(JavaVersion.TWENTY_ONE) static class OnJava21 {} } @Service @Conditional(OnUnsupportedJavaVersionCondition.class) public class UnsupportedJavaVersionTestService { // . . . } By default, if we add multiple @ConditionalOn…​ annotations to a bean, they will be combined using AND logic As @Conditional annotation cannot be specified multiple types in a class / method, we only use custom @ConditionalOn…​ annotations to achieve this (or one @Conditional plus other @ConditionalOn…​ for each additional condition) Spring context allows us to get unique instances of the same bean every time we ask for it when they are scoped as prototype beans. This scope is specified using @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) in the bean definition along with @Service, @Component, @Bean, @Repository annotations in bean definition: @Service @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) public class PrototypeServiceImpl implements PrototypeService { // . . . } @Configuration public class ServiceConfig { @Bean @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) public PrototypeService simplePrototypeService() { return new PrototypeServiceImpl(); } } We can obtain an instance of them in multiple ways: Using @Autowired annotation. This will inject a unique instance that will not be shared in other injection points. This example code injects instances of the same type for a prototype bean. As prototype beans are not shared across multiple injections points, the injected services are different instances. @Service class ExampleService { @Autowired private PrototypeService serviceInstance1; @Autowired private PrototypeService serviceInstance2; } Using ObjectProvider. We will obtain a new instance every time we call getObject method. E.G: import org.springframework.beans.factory.ObjectProvider; @Service class ExampleService { @Autowired private ObjectProvider prototypeServices; public void doSomething() { final PrototypeService instance = prototypeServices.getObject(); // . . . } } Directly from Spring's ApplicationContext, every time we call getBean() method. E.G: import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext; @Service class ExampleService { @Autowired private ObjectProvider prototypeServices; public void doSomething() { final PrototypeService instance = applicationContext.getBean(PrototypeService.class); // . . . } } Using a custom factory. This also allows to parameterize bean creation: import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanDefinition; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope; @Configuration public class ParameterizedServicePrototypeFactory { @Bean @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) public ParameterizedService get(String parameter) { return new ParameterizedServiceImpl(parameter); } } import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanDefinition; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope; @Service class ExampleService { @Autowired private ParameterizedServicePrototypeFactory serviceFactory; public void doSomething() { final ParameterizedService actualInstance1 = parameterizedServicePrototypeFactory.get(\"A_PARAMETER\"); // . . . } } In this case we will not mark bean implementation with any stereotype like @Service, @Component, etc. as the factory is in charge of create the bean: public class ParameterizedServiceImpl implements ParameterizedService { private final String name; public ParameterizedServiceImpl(String name) { this.name = name; } // . . . } When the creation of a specific bean type requires a complex logic, we can encapsulate this in a FactoryBean class and delegate the creation of the bean to it. For that we must define a class implementing the FactoryBean interface of extending the class AbstractFactoryBean, being T the type of the bean to create: import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.AbstractFactoryBean; public class ComplexServiceFactoryBean extends AbstractFactoryBean { private final DependencyService dependencyService; private String configurationValue; public ComplexServiceFactoryBean(DependencyService dependencyService) { this.dependencyService = dependencyService; // Singleton by default. Set `false` to create prototype instances // setSingleton(false); } public ComplexServiceFactoryBean setConfigurationValue(String configurationValue) { this.configurationValue = configurationValue; return this; } @Override public Class getObjectType() { return ComplexService.class; } @Override protected ComplexService createInstance() throws Exception { return new ComplexServiceImpl(dependencyService) .setConfigurationValue(configurationValue); } } And then configure the FactoryBean as a bean using the name that will we assigned to the final bean, complexService in the example: @Configuration public class FactoryBeanConfig { @Bean(\"complexService\") public ComplexServiceFactoryBean complexServiceFactory(DependencyService dependencyService) { return new ComplexServiceFactoryBean(dependencyService) .setConfigurationValue(\"configuration_value\"); } } After that, we will be capable of injecting bean instances that will be singletons of prototypes depending on the configuration made in the FactoryBean (see setSingleton method): @Autowired private ComplexService complexService; @Autowired private ComplexServiceFactoryBean complexServiceFactoryBean; // . . . ComplexService serviceFromFactory = complexServiceFactoryBean.getObject(); Using the bean name configured in the @Bean annotation of the interface, we will also be able of retrieving bean instance and its related FactoryBean through ApplicationContext @Autowired private ApplicationContext context; // . . . // It is needed to add a '&' to the bean name to retrieve factory instance and then the bean instance through the getObjectMethod ComplexService localService1 = ((ComplexServiceFactoryBean) context.getBean(\"&complexService\")).getObject(); // And use the bean name directly to retrieve the bean instance ComplexService localService2 = (ComplexService) context.getBean(\"complexService\");","title":"Dependency injection","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"dependency-injection","url":"/springboot-showcase/spring-docs/how-to/dependency-injection.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"Optional and multiple bindings","hash":"optional-and-multiple-bindings","id":2},{"text":"Primary bean","hash":"primary-bean","id":3},{"text":"Qualifiers","hash":"qualifiers","id":4},{"text":"Injecting Optional, List and ObjectProvider","hash":"injecting-optional-list-and-objectprovider","id":5},{"text":"Conditional binding","hash":"conditional-binding","id":6},{"text":"Custom conditions","hash":"custom-conditions","id":7},{"text":"Combining conditions","hash":"combining-conditions","id":8},{"text":"Prototype scoped beans","hash":"prototype-scoped-beans","id":9},{"text":"FactoryBean","hash":"factorybean","id":10}]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"[ TODO ]","title":"Observability","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"observability","url":"/springboot-showcase/spring-docs/how-to/observability.html","titles":[]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"[ TODO ]","title":"Testing","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"testing","url":"/springboot-showcase/spring-docs/how-to/testing.html","titles":[]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"TODO jakarta.validation.groups allow us to configure the constraints to be validated depending on the context. For example, in some situations may have sense only to validate certain constraints when a domain entity is being created (not managed) and not when is updated (managed), the ID and creation / update timestamps for example. In that case we can define the constraints that will be executed in each case using different groups: public record Schema( @Null(groups = { NotManaged.class }) @NotNull(groups = { Managed.class }) Long id, @NotNull String externalId, @NotNull String name, @Null(groups = { NotManaged.class }) @NotNull(groups = { Managed.class }) LocalDateTime creationDate, @Null(groups = { NotManaged.class }) @NotNull(groups = { Managed.class }) LocalDateTime lastUpdated ) { // . . . } In this example, the ID and creation / updated timestamps attributes will be forced to be null only when the object is not managed by the application. Any constraint not assigned explicitly to any group will be assigned to the default group. Custom validation groups can be defined as interfaces as following: public final class CommonValidationGroups { private CommonValidationGroups() { } public interface NotManaged { } public interface Managed { } } Then, when we configure a validation for an object, using the Validator object directly or using Spring’s @Validated annotation, we can specify one or more validation groups to be evaluated. import jakarta.validation.groups.Default; @Validated({ Default.class, NotManaged.class }) public Schema createSchema(@Valid Schema schema) { // . . . } @Validated({ Default.class, Managed.class }) public Schema updateSchema(@Valid Schema schema) { // . . . } import jakarta.validation.groups.Default; import jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolation; import jakarta.validation.Validation; import jakarta.validation.Validator; // . . . final Validator validator = Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory().getValidator(); final Schema schema = // . . . Set> constraintViolations = validator.validate(providedStore, Default.class, CommonValidationGroups.Managed.class); We have to specify the jakarta.validation.groups.Default so the validations not assigned explicitly to any group are executed (E.G. the @NotNull constraint on externalId and name fields).

Along with Assertj Core, that implement general purpose assertions, Asserj provides other useful modules that provide assertions to be used with data structures provided by other technologies, like Neo4J, Joda Time, Guava…​ This guide is focused on the Assertj-DB module that provides assertions to access a DB and check directly the data stored inside. To start using Assertj-db it is needed to add the following dependency to the project org.assertj assertj-db 3.0.0 test 3.0.0 is the last version published at the time of writing this guide. It also includes the assertj-core module dependency. To make use of the assertions provided by the library on the database data, first of all we need to configure a AssertDbConnection. For simple tests through JDBC statements, it is enough to configure it using the connection URL: AssertDbConnection connection = AssertDbConnectionFactory.of(\"jdbc:h2:mem:test\", \"sa\", \"\").create(); Or if we have a javax.sql.DataSource available: AssertDbConnection connection = AssertDbConnectionFactory.of(dataSource).create(); For Spring JPA tests involving transactions is a bit more tricky since we need that the connection obtained by Assertj-db is the one involved in the transaction. For that reason, we need to use a proxy: import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy; // . . . private AssertDbConnection connection; @BeforeEach void setUp() { /* It is needed to wrap dataSource to allow access to current transaction connection. * Otherwise, AssertDbConnection won't be allowed to access uncommitted changes */ connection = AssertDbConnectionFactory.of(new TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy(dataSource)) .create(); } After that, we can make use of the different APIs that the library provide us to assert the data stored in the database. We can access data in three ways: We can access directly a table and inspect its rows: import static org.assertj.db.api.Assertions.assertThat; // . . . final LocalDateTime referenceDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(); Table productTable = connection.table(\"PRODUCT\").build(); assertThat(productTable) .hasNumberOfRows(6) .row(0) .value(\"ID\").isNotNull() .value(\"VERSION\").isNotNull() .value(\"EXTERNAL_ID\").isEqualTo(\"test-product\") .value(\"NAME\").isEqualTo(\"Test product\") .value(\"CATEGORY_ID\").isEqualTo(1001L) .value(\"CREATION_DATE\").isAfter(DateTimeValue.from(referenceDateTime)) .value(\"LAST_UPDATED\").isAfter(DateTimeValue.from(referenceDateTime)); In this example we assert that the table has exactly a number of rows and that the values of the first one are the ones that we expect. It is also possible to inspect a single column values using the column() selector: Table productTable = connection.table(\"PRODUCT\").build(); assertThat(productTable) .column(\"EXTERNAL_ID\") .hasValues(\"product-1.1\", \"product-1.2\", \"product-2.1\", \"product-2.2\", \"product-3.1\") .column(\"NAME\") .hasValues(\"Product 1.1\", \"Product 1.2\", \"Product 2.1\", \"Product 2.2\", \"Product 3.1\"); If we need to data involving multiple tables, we can inspect a specific set of data using a Request with a query: Request request = connection.request(\"\"\" select p.EXTERNAL_ID as PROD_EXTID, c.EXTERNAL_ID as CAT_EXTID from PRODUCT p, CATEGORY c where p.CATEGORY_ID = c.ID and p.id = ? \"\"\") .parameters(1001L) .build(); assertThat(request) .hasNumberOfRows(1) .column(\"PROD_EXTID\") .hasValues(\"product-1.1\") .column(\"CAT_EXTID\") .hasValues(\"category-1\"); When the test requires insert, update or delete data from the database, we can use the changes API as it allows to assert specifically the changed data. To do that, we need to mark a checkpoint before and after the changes are made to the database using the methods setStartPointNow() and setEndPointNow() after obtaining a Changes instance that we will use in the assertions final Changes changes = connection.changes().build(); changes.setStartPointNow(); // Do some modifications changes.setEndPointNow(); assertThat(changes) .hasNumberOfChanges(1) (1) .onTable(\"PRODUCT\") (2) .hasNumberOfChanges(1) .changeOfCreation() (3) .rowAtEndPoint() (4) .value(\"ID\").isNotNull() .value(\"VERSION\").isNotNull() .value(\"EXTERNAL_ID\").isEqualTo(\"test-product\") .value(\"NAME\").isEqualTo(\"Test product\") .value(\"CATEGORY_ID\").isEqualTo(1001L) .value(\"CREATION_DATE\").isAfter(DateTimeValue.from(referenceDateTime)) .value(\"LAST_UPDATED\").isAfter(DateTimeValue.from(referenceDateTime)); 1 We can check the total number of changes made in the database 2 Or the number of changes in a specific table 3 It is possible to also discriminate by change type (changeOfCreation(), changeOfModification() or changeOfDeletion()) 4 And then check the data after the change When it is needed to assert database changes made by Spring JPA repositories, or generalizing, made with an ORM like Hibernate we have to take into consideration when the changes are available to be read by the assert statements. As we said previously, if we have an uncommited transaction, the used connection should be the same involved in the transaction and in case of using a ORM the entity manager must have flushed changes. In this example we show an example of the whole case of make changes through a Spring JPA repository and assert these changes using Assertj-DB import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager; import javax.sql.DataSource; import org.assertj.db.type.AssertDbConnection; import org.assertj.db.type.AssertDbConnectionFactory; // . . . @Autowired private DataSource dataSource; @Autowired private EntityManager entityManager; @Autowired private ProductRepository productRepository; @Autowired private CategoryRepository categoryRepository; private AssertDbConnection connection; @BeforeEach void setUp() { /* It is needed to wrap datasource to allow access to current transaction connection. * Otherwise, AssertDbConnection won't be allowed to access uncommited changes */ connection = AssertDbConnectionFactory.of(new TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy(dataSource)) .create(); } @Test @DisplayName(\"Check an inserted row using change API\") @Transactional void changeApiTest1() { final LocalDateTime referenceDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(); final Changes changes = connection.changes().build(); changes.setStartPointNow(); CategoryEntity categoryEntity = categoryRepository.findById(1001L) .orElseThrow(); ProductEntity productEntity = ProductEntity.builder() .externalId(\"test-product\") .name(\"Test product\") .category(categoryEntity) .build(); productRepository.save(productEntity); (1) entityManager.flush(); (2) changes.setEndPointNow(); assertThat(changes) .hasNumberOfChanges(1) .onTable(\"PRODUCT\") .hasNumberOfChanges(1) .changeOfCreation() .rowAtEndPoint() .value(\"ID\").isNotNull() .value(\"VERSION\").isNotNull() .value(\"EXTERNAL_ID\").isEqualTo(\"test-product\") .value(\"NAME\").isEqualTo(\"Test product\") .value(\"CATEGORY_ID\").isEqualTo(1001L) .value(\"CREATION_DATE\").isAfter(DateTimeValue.from(referenceDateTime)) .value(\"LAST_UPDATED\").isAfter(DateTimeValue.from(referenceDateTime)); } 1 Do some changes in the database 2 Flush those changes so they are visible when the assertions are executed Since 2.0.0, AssertJ-DB baseline is Java 8. The preferred way to compare values with date, time and date/time is to use java.time.LocalDate, java.time.LocalTime, java.time.LocalDateTime directly. For the backward compatibility, it’s always possible to use AssertJ-DB DateValue, TimeValue and DateTimeValue utilities: final LocalDateTime referenceDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(); Table productTable = connection.table(\"PRODUCT\").build(); assertThat(productTable) .row(0) // . . . .value(\"CREATION_DATE\").isAfter(DateTimeValue.from(referenceDateTime)) (1) .value(\"LAST_UPDATED\").isAfter(DateTimeValue.from(referenceDateTime)); 1 Timestamp columns are compared using Java’s LocalDateTime through DateTimeValue utility class Assertj GitHub repository Assertj-DB home page","title":"Assertj-DB","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"assertj-db","url":"/springboot-showcase/testing/how-to/assertj/assertj-db.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"Connection","hash":"connection","id":2},{"text":"APIs","hash":"apis","id":3},{"text":"Table API","hash":"table-api","id":4},{"text":"Request API","hash":"request-api","id":5},{"text":"Changes API","hash":"changes-api","id":6},{"text":"Note about using Assertj-DB in Spring JPA tests","hash":"note-about-using-assertj-db-in-spring-jpa-tests","id":7},{"text":"DateValue, TimeValue and DateTimeValue","hash":"datevalue-timevalue-and-datetimevalue","id":8},{"text":"References","hash":"references","id":9}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"JUnit provides mechanisms to execute a test multiple times with different input values. Here is a basic quick guide on how to create a more reusable test code base using these capabilities. JUnits parameterized tests requires the junit-jupiter-params dependency: pom.xml org.junit.jupiter junit-jupiter-params test Once included, @Test methods can be transformed into @ParameterizedTest to allow test input parameters that can be used to provide different fixture or expected values to each test execution. Depending on the source specified (@*Source) annotation we will be able to specify these values from using different data sources. Example of parameterized test using a simple numeric data source: @ParameterizedTest @ValueSource(longs = { 100L, 200L, 300L }) void valueSourceTest1(Long param) { // . . . } Allow specifying a single parameter to the test method. Supported types include shorts, bytes, ints, longs, floats, doubles, chars, booleans, strings and classes. Only one of the supported types may be specified per declaration. @ParameterizedTest @ValueSource(strings = { \"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\" }) void valueSourceTest(String param) { assertThat(param) .describedAs(\"actualResult\") .isNotNull() .hasSizeGreaterThanOrEqualTo(0); } The @ValueSource annotation doesn’t accept null values. You can use @NullSource to provide a null argument for the test Provides an empty value to compatible types, including: String java.util.Collection and concrete subtypes with a public no-arg constructor java.util.List java.util.Set java.util.SortedSet java.util.NavigableSet java.util.Map and concrete subtypes with a public no-arg constructor java.util.SortedMap java.util.NavigableMap Primitive arrays, for example int[], char[][] Object arrays, for example String[], Integer[][] Provides a null parameter value to compatible types. Cannot be used for an argument that has a primitive type. Combines @EmptySource and @NullSource in one annotation, providing both null and empty values to compatible parameters Allow specifying Enum constant values as test input parameter, optionally restricting it to a set of them using names and mode annotation fields. For example, in the following test method, a value of the MeasureUnit enum is provided in each execution. Values are restricted to the provided names as default mode is INCLUDE. @ParameterizedTest @EnumSource(value = MeasureUnit.class, names = { \"KILOMETER\", \"METER\", \"CENTIMETER\" }) void enumSourceTest(MeasureUnit measureUnit) { // . . . } Annotations described above can be combined to provide multiple parameters to the test. For example, to add null and empty cases to String test inputs: @ParameterizedTest @ValueSource(strings = { \"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\" }) @EmptySource @NullSource void valueSourceTest(String param) { // . . . } Allows to specify @ParameterizedTest method parameter as inline CSV on every row is a set of parameter values that will be supplied as parameters. @CsvSource allows specifying content as a text block for Java 17+ or as an array. @CsvSource using an array of Strings @ParameterizedTest @CsvSource( delimiterString = \";\", value = { \"# KEY; VALUE; RESULT\", \"Key1; 1; 'TestDataMethod1:1'\", \"Key2; 2; 'TestDataMethod2:2'\", \"Key3; 3; 'TestDataMethod3:3'\" } ) void csvSourceTest( String providedKey, Integer providedValue, String expectedResult ) { // . . . } @CsvSource using a text block @ParameterizedTest @CsvSource( delimiterString = \";\", quoteCharacter = '\"', textBlock = \"\"\" # KEY; VALUE; RESULT \"Key1\"; 1; \"TestDataMethod1:1\" \"Key2\"; 2; \"TestDataMethod2:2\" \"Key3\"; 3; \"TestDataMethod3:3\" \"\"\" ) void csvSourceTest( String providedKey, Integer providedValue, String expectedResult ) { // . . . } We can use # character to include a header with column names that will be ignored but is useful to identify every column. It also provides attributes to customize the format of the CSV, like the delimiter (, by default) and quote character (' by default) used. Same as @CsvSource but the values are located in a file in the classpath or project’s root folder. As with @CsvSource using a text block, any line beginning with a # symbol will be interpreted as a comment and will be ignored. @ParameterizedTest @CsvFileSource( delimiterString = \";\", quoteCharacter = '\"', // Skip header numLinesToSkip = 1, // Use files to search in project root folder // files = { \"./parameterized_tests_csv_file_source.csv\" } // Use resources to search in classpath resources = { \"/parameterized_tests_csv_file_source.csv\" } ) void csvFileSourceTest1( String providedKey, Integer providedValue, String expectedResult ) { // . . . } @MethodSource annotation allow us to define complex test parameters using a static method as provider. We have to specify the provider method name as the annotation value attribute or leave it unspecified if the provider method has the same name as the test method. Provider method should return a Stream where every element is a tuple of parameter for a single test method invocation. @ParameterizedTest @MethodSource(\"provideTestData\") void methodSourceTest( String providedKey, Integer providedValue, String expectedResult ) { // . . . } private static Stream provideTestData() { return Stream.of( Arguments.of(\"Key1\", 1, \"Result1\"), Arguments.of(\"Key2\", 2, \"Result2\"), Arguments.of(\"Key3\", 3, \"Result3\") ); } @MethodSource data provider method is inferred from test name if not specified @ParameterizedTest @MethodSource void methodSourceTest( String providedKey, Integer providedValue, String expectedResult ) { // . . . } private static Stream methodSourceTest() { return Stream.of( // . . . ); } Since JUnit 5.11 we can use @FieldSource experimental annotation to define @ParameterizedTest parameters using a static class field which name is referenced in the annotation. private static final List fieldSourceTestData = List.of(\"VALUE1\", \"VALUE2\", \"VALUE3\"); @ParameterizedTest @FieldSource(\"fieldSourceTestData\") void fieldSourceTest(String providedKey) { // . . . } If no field names are declared, a field within the test class that has the same name as the test method will be used as the field by default. Static fields can be defined as: @ParameterizedTest method static field void test(String) static List params void test(String) static String[] params void test(int) static int[] params void test(int[]) static int[][] params void test(String, String) static String[][] params void test(String, int) static Object[][] params void test(int) static Supplier paramSupplier void test(String) static Supplier> paramSupplier void test(String, int) static Supplier> paramSupplier void test(String, int) static Supplier> paramSupplier void test(int[]) static Supplier> paramSupplier void test(int[][]) static Supplier> paramSupplier void test(Object[][]) static Supplier> paramSupplier Custom annotations can be defined to provide your own way to define @ParameterizedTest parameters. For example, the following custom annotation allows defining a fixed number of sample parameters that will be provided to the test method. The implementation in charge of generating these parameters is specified by the @ArgumentsSource annotation @Documented @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @ArgumentsSource(SamplesArgumentProvider.class) public @interface SamplesSource { int DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES = 3; int value() default DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES; } And the implementation of the provider, implementing the AnnotationConsumer interface for the previous annotation public class SamplesArgumentProvider implements ArgumentsProvider, AnnotationConsumer { private int numberOfSamples = SamplesSource.DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES; /** * Access the annotation definition in the test method */ @Override public void accept(SamplesSource samplesSource) { validateSampleSource(samplesSource); this.numberOfSamples = samplesSource.value(); } /** * Provide test method parameters as a Stream of arguments (like in @MethodSource) */ @Override public Stream provideArguments(ExtensionContext context) throws Exception { return IntStream.range(0, numberOfSamples) .mapToObj(this::buildSample); } private void validateSampleSource(SamplesSource samplesSource) { if (samplesSource.value() methodSourceTest() { return Stream.of( Arguments.of(Named.of(\"Sample key 1\", \"Key1\"), 1, Named.of(\"A sample result 1\", \"Result1\")), Arguments.of(Named.of(\"Sample key 2\", \"Key2\"), 1, Named.of(\"A sample result 2\", \"Result2\")), Arguments.of(Named.of(\"Sample key 3\", \"Key3\"), 1, Named.of(\"A sample result 3\", \"Result3\")) ); } In that case test name will be like this: tested method should return 1 - A sample result 2 when key = Sample key 1 and value = 1 are provided","title":"Parameterized tests","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"parameterized-tests","url":"/springboot-showcase/testing/how-to/junit/parameterized-tests.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"Parameter source types","hash":"parameter-source-types","id":2},{"text":"Single parameter","hash":"single-parameter","id":3},{"text":"@ValueSource","hash":"valuesource","id":4},{"text":"@EmptySource","hash":"emptysource","id":5},{"text":"@NullSource","hash":"nullsource","id":6},{"text":"@NullAndEmptySource","hash":"nullandemptysource","id":7},{"text":"@EnumSource","hash":"enumsource","id":8},{"text":"Combining multiple annotations","hash":"combining-multiple-annotations","id":9},{"text":"Multiple parameters","hash":"multiple-parameters","id":10},{"text":"@CsvSource","hash":"csvsource","id":11},{"text":"@CsvFileSource","hash":"csvfilesource","id":12},{"text":"@MethodSource","hash":"methodsource","id":13},{"text":"@FieldSource","hash":"fieldsource","id":14},{"text":"Custom annotated source","hash":"custom-annotated-source","id":15},{"text":"Access arguments","hash":"access-arguments","id":16},{"text":"ArgumentsAccessor","hash":"argumentsaccessor","id":17},{"text":"AggregateWith","hash":"aggregatewith","id":18},{"text":"Display name and test name","hash":"display-name-and-test-name","id":19}]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"TODO","title":"Decorate a Spring bean","component":"springboot-showcase","version":"","name":"decorate_a_spring_bean","url":"/springboot-showcase/spring-docs/tutorial/spring-core/decorate_a_spring_bean.html","titles":[]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"Change test class annotations.
