= Fluent REST API client
:toc:

WIP

== Concept

This document introduces the design of a fluid API to execute different operations defined by a remote service.

API in subdomains and operations

To illustrate the design, we will take the following service API as an example:

[plantuml]
----
@startwbs
* Client
** Info
*** Version
** Schema
*** List
*** Detail
*** Create
*** Update
*** Delete
** . . .
@endwbs
----

== General structure

=== Client
Wraps the underlying client that will be used to consume the API, also providing a builder
to create and configure it. This client wrapper creates an independent layer that makes possible
to use different underlying clients (E.G. Spring's `RestClient`, `RestTemplate`, `OkHttp3`...)
maintaining the same API.

Client API provides access to ...

=== API Builders

=== Operations
