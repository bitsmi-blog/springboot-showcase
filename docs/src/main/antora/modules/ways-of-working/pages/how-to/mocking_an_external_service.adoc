= Mocking external services

== Wiremock

If we need to mock an external service during application development, we can configure a **Wiremock container**
as part of the `docker-compose-DEV.yaml` service stack:

[source,yaml]
----
# . . .
services:
  # . . .
  wiremock:
    container_name: wiremock
    image: "wiremock/wiremock:3.4.2-1"
    ports:
      - 8100:8080
    entrypoint: [ "/docker-entrypoint.sh", "--global-response-templating", "--disable-gzip", "--verbose" ]
    volumes:
      - ./wiremock/extensions:/var/wiremock/extensions
      - ./wiremock/__files:/home/wiremock/__files
      - ./wiremock/mappings:/home/wiremock/mappings

----

This configuration allow us to access mock server through port `8100`. The specified `volumes` configuration
make possible to load mock expectations at startup:

* **extensions**: Folder that will contain additional **Wiremock** extensions, for example, to allow processing **gRPC** or **GraphQL** messaging.
* **__files**: Folder that will contain files that will be served directly as a kind of `public` folder.
This is useful for referencing content files inside `expectation configuration` files.
* **mappings**: Folder that will contain `expectation configuration` files in form of `json` files.

=== Expectations configuration

Every `expectation configuration` file will contain a `single` expectation configured as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
    "priority": 10,
    "request": {

    },
    "response": {

    }
}
----

* **priority**: A number indicating the priority of this configuration when a request matches multiple expectations.
The one with a lower priority wins.
* **request**: Request matcher configuration for the expectation
* **response**: Configuration of the response that will be returned if the expectation is selected.

==== Request matcher

The `request` section of the `expectation configuration` allows the specification of multiple matchers that determines if
a request is selectable for this expectation, including:

* **method**: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
* **urlPath**: Path without query parameters
* **url**: Full url with including query parameters
* **queryParameters**: Matchers for individual query parameters. Parameter values can be matched using a series of matchers including:
    ** Match exactly (`equalsTo`),
    ** Using a regular expressions (`matches`)
    ** Containing a value (`contains`)

==== Response configuration

The response that will be returned as the result of the matching expectation can be configured with the following information:

* **status**: HTTP status code for the response
* **headers**: Map containing the headers carried by the response
* **body**: Plain text data that will be returned as response body
* **jsonBody**: JSON data that will be returned as response body
* **bodyFileName**: Path relative to `__files` folder containing the raw content of response body

==== Example

The following example matches a request to the `/api/inventory` endpoint that provides `selector`, `page` and `pageSize` query parameters
that matches exactly the specified values. A response with status code `200` and a JSON body will bre returned.
The content of this response is located in `api/inventory/get_list_body.json` file located in the `__files` folder.

[source,json]
----
{
    "priority": 10,
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "urlPath": "/api/inventory",
        "queryParameters": {
            "selector": {
                "equalTo": "id EQUALS 1"
            },
            "page": {
                "equalTo": "0"
            },
            "pageSize": {
                "equalTo": "10"
            }
        }
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "bodyFileName": "api/inventory/get_list_body.json"
    }
}
----

=== Wiremock Admin API

Once the service is started, we can manage expectations using Wiremock's Admin API as follows:

**Get all defined expectations**
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8100/__admin/mappings
----

**Create a new expectation using the API**
[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
    "id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
	"priority": 10,
	"request": {
		"method": "GET",
		"url": "/api/sample"
	},
	"response": {
		"status": 200,
		"headers": {
			"Content-Type": "application/json"
		},
		"bodyFileName": "api/sample/get_sample_body.json"
	}
}
' http://localhost:8100/__admin/mappings
----

**Update an existing expectation using the API**
[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
	"priority": 10,
	"request": {
		"method": "GET",
		"url": "/api/sample"
	},
	"response": {
		"status": 200,
		"headers": {
			"Content-Type": "application/json"
		},
		"jsonBody": [1, 2, 3, 4]
	}
}
' http://localhost:8100/__admin/mappings/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
----

**Reload expectations from /mappings files**

NOTE: This option makes possible to modify expectations editing mappings files directly and then reload Wiremock state

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/__admin/mappings/reset
----
